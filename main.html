			<h1>Universe</h1>
			<p>The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. 
			It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, 
			and even time. Before the birth of the Universe, time, 
			space and matter did not exist.

			The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. 
			The space between the stars and galaxies is largely empty. However, 
			even places far from stars and planets contain scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter. 
			Space is also filled with radiation (e.g. light and heat), 
			magnetic fields and high energy particles (e.g. cosmic rays).</p>

			<h1>Milky-Way Galaxy</h1>
			<p>A glance up at the night sky reveals a broad swath of light. 
			Described by the ancients as a river, as milk, and as a path, 
			among other things, the band has been visible in the heavens since Earth first formed. 
			In reality, this intriguing line of light is the center of our galaxy, 
			as seen from one of its outer arms.
			The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, about 100,000 light-years across. 
			If you could look down on it from the top, 
			you would see a central bulge surrounded by four large spiral arms that wrap around it. 
			Spiral galaxies make up about two-third of the galaxies in the universe.</p>

			<h1>Earth</h1>
			<p>Earth is the planet we live on. 
			It is the third planet from the Sun. 
			It is the only planet known to have life on it. 
			The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. 
			It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. 
			The other three are Mercury, Venus, and Mars.

			The large mass of the Sun makes Earth move around it, 
			just as the mass of Earth makes the moon move around it. 
			Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. 
			Earth goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365​1⁄4 times it turns around (one day).
